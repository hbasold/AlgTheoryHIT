Implementation of free algebraic theories as HITs.
The ultimate goal is to construct initial algebras/final coalgebras as inductive/coinductive types
over such free algebras.
They would then be strictly positive, but allow complex identifications.
An example is the finite powerset to, for example, model the semantics of finitely branching transition
systems.
